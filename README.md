Simple deep learning from numpy for Will (thus the silly names).

Mostly a learning project but I can see some benefits of using this. It's based entirely on numpy so only needs a CPU. Easily parallelisable, unlike a tensorflow or keras session (I use this is another project). And it's pretty fast (if you don't compare to deep learning libraries that exploit GPUs).

I will restructure the directory so that it's organised (and can be used/imported) as a library.
